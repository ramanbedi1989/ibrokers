			<h3 class="about-heading">Income Protection Insurance</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					If you cannot earn an income, your lifestyle will suffer and you will be forced to make changes. You will probably find it more difficult to meet your living costs when you are disabled than when you could work. It is most likely that you will go back to work and be reasonably fit again. But there could come a time when you don’t recover.
				</p>

				<p>
					You can insure your income to cover such situations – think about what will happen to your life and your career while you are off work.
