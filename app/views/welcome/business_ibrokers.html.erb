				Business Interruption Cover is very important – this sometimes can be the sole reason that many businesses don’t survive a major loss. For example, when a disaster strikes, a business may have to let key staff go because they can’t pay them. Then, when the business is ready to re-open, these skilled people have found other jobs. If machinery is covered for breakdown, but not Business Interruption, there is no cover for lost turnover while a machine is being repaired or replaced.
