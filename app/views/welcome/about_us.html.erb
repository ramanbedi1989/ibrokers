				<h4>Why Insurance</h4>
				<p>
					You've worked hard to build a solid financial footing for you and your family, so you want to be sure that everything is protected. Accidents and unexpected events can and do happen, and if you arenâ€™t adequately insured, it could leave you in financial ruin. You need insurance to protect your life, your ability to earn income, and to keep a roof over your head.
